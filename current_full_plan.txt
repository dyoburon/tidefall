Step 1: Implement Click-Based Navigation System
File: src/core/shipController.js

Add new navigation variables:
targetDestination - Vector3 position representing click destination
isNavigatingToDestination - Boolean flag for auto-navigation state
navigationTolerance - Distance threshold to consider destination reached
maxNavigationTime - Safety timeout for navigation attempts
navigationStartTime - To track time spent navigating to a destination
File: src/core/main.js

Remove the existing keyboard event listeners for ship movement (WASD controls)
Implement a new click event listener that:
Uses the existing worldRaycaster.screenToWorld() function to get the world position
Sets the navigation target in the ship controller
Creates a visual marker at the click location
Keep keyboard listeners for non-movement commands (inventory, abilities, etc.)
Step 2: Enhance Ship Movement Logic
File: src/core/shipController.js

Add a new function navigateToDestination(destination) to:
Set the target destination
Enable navigation mode
Reset navigation timers
Modify updateShipMovement() to:
Check if navigation is active
Calculate direction to target
Set appropriate virtual "key" states based on navigation needs
Handle reaching the destination or timing out
Add a function to cancel navigation (for manual override)
Maintain the existing physics model for consistent ship handling
Step 3: Visual Feedback & UI Integration
File: src/core/main.js and potentially a new visual effect file

Create visual indicators for destination and path:
Add a marker mesh at the click location
Implement a fading effect for the marker
Optionally add a line or particle effect showing the path
Add visual feedback when:
Destination is set (confirmation)
Destination is reached
Navigation is canceled
Ensure mouse cursor changes to indicate clickable water areas
