Step 1: Add Cannon Network Communication in network.js
I'll need to modify the following in network.js:

Add new functions to communicate cannon events:
fireCannon(position, direction) - To send cannon firing events to the server
onCannonHit(callback) - To register a callback for when a player is hit by a cannon
Add new socket event listeners in the setupSocketEvents() function:
Listen for 'cannon_fired' events from other players
Listen for 'cannon_hit' events when a player is hit
Step 2: Implement Server-side Cannon Handling in app.py
I'll need to modify the following in app.py:

Add new data structure for cannon tracking:
Create a cannons dictionary to store active cannon projectiles
Track essential properties like position, direction, owner, timestamp
Add new socket event handlers:
handle_cannon_fire() - To receive and broadcast cannon fire events
handle_cannon_hit() - To validate and process hit events
Add cannon collision detection logic:
Implement functions to check if cannons hit other players
Broadcast hit events to affected players
Handle damage calculations and player state updates
Step 3: Connect Client and Server Components
Ensure the client properly sends cannon firing events
Process incoming cannon events from other players
Handle hit notifications and apply appropriate effects
Implement cooldown mechanism for cannon ability

For all changes that would be in app.py make it a separate file and integrate it.
