Step 1: Create a Centralized Respawn Manager in network.js
File: src/core/network.js

Create a new centralized respawnManager object with methods:
initRespawnManager: Set up the manager with needed references
startRespawn: Handle the respawn countdown and UI
completeRespawn: Handle the actual respawning process
setRespawnPosition: Determine the respawn position (centralized logic)
Refactor the existing startRespawnProcess and endRespawnProcess functions to use the new respawn manager
Step 2: Fix Camera Control Reset during Respawn
File: src/controls/cameraControls.js

Enhance the resetCameraPosition function to properly reconnect to the new player model
Add a new reconnectControlsToModel function that will:
Update any camera target references
Reset the camera orbit parameters
Reinitialize any touch/mouse controls that reference the boat
Step 3: Connect the Systems
File: src/core/network.js

Modify the endRespawnProcess function to:
Call the appropriate camera control reconnect functions after creating the new boat model
Ensure proper state is passed to the camera controls
Update any references in playerState to the new boat model
Step 4: Update Game State and Movement Controls
File: src/core/network.js

Add a function to update the boat reference in gameState.js
Make sure to call this after creating the new boat model in endRespawnProcess
Verify that all systems using the boat reference are updated
Add validation code to check that the controls are properly connected to the new boat model by:
Verifying the boat reference is updated in all necessary places (gameState.js, shipController.js)
Ensuring any input handlers are properly connected to the new boat
Testing that movement keys trigger the expected boat behavior after respawn
