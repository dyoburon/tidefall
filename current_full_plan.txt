Step 1: Separate MiniMap into its own Module
File: src/ui/miniMap.js (New File)

Extract the MiniMap class from chat.js to this new dedicated file
Enhance the class with the radar mode functionality:
Add currentRadarMode property to track active mode (monster/fish/treasure)
Add new marker collections for fish and treasure
Create a setRadarMode(mode) method to handle switching between modes
Implement visualization methods for each mode
Export the MiniMap class and an initialization function
Step 2: Update Chat.js to Focus on Chat Functionality
File: src/ui/chat.js

Remove the MiniMap class and related code
Keep the UI container creation for the map display
Update imports to reference the new miniMap.js file
Modify initChat() to no longer handle minimap initialization
Step 3: Create Integration Module for Chat and MiniMap
File: src/ui/navigation.js (New File)

Create a module that handles the integration of chat UI and minimap
Implement methods to connect the radar container (from chat UI) with the minimap functionality
Add the radar mode toggle UI controls here
Provide methods for the game to update entity data (monsters, fish, treasure)
Export an initialization function that sets everything up
Step 4: Update UI.js to Use the New Structure
File: src/ui/ui.js

Update imports to reference the new file structure
Modify the GameUI constructor to initialize chat and minimap separately
Connect the game data sources to the appropriate radar modes
Ensure the radar mode switch is accessible from the main UI
