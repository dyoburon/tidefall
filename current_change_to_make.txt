We currently want to implement respawning when the player dies. There is some logic there already, but it's not designed in a very good way. We want to clean this up and make sure that there's a central place for the logic to spawn a player rather than duplicated logic in various places.

Right now, the controls don't get reset to the new model when they respawn
